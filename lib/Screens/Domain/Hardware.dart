                                "The boom in demand of electronic devices has triggered growth of hardware startups around the world. According to a joint study brought out by Assocham and NEC Technologies in the year 2014, India’s total electronics hardware production estimates for 2014-15 stood at 32.46 billion which is about 1.5% of world electronic hardware production.  The domestic consumption of electronic hardware in 2014-15 was 63.6 billion and 58% of this demand was fulfilled with imports. This opens up a huge opportunity for hardware based technology startups. India has been traditionally very strong in the software and tech-enabled services startup area. However, hardware startups face a very different set of problems in comparison to these companies. These challenges are related to a longer innovation cycle, technology infrastructure requirement for manufacturing and fulfilment, competition from low cost devices from other countries, to name a few. This makes building a hardware company a much more involved process than software or Internet related models.  ",
