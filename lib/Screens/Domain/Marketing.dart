Instead, successful marketing startups are those which evolve with the ever-growing demands of marketing, whether they be in the digital or off-line categories, or in the rapidly growing area of content marketing. No business can grow without a proper marketing plan and startups are no different. A startup marketing strategy outlines a startup’s direction and approach to reach its goals. In practical terms, a sound marketing plan acts as a road-map to the success of the startups. A marketing plan consists of strategies for promoting startup products and services.  While there is no set template, generally, it includes a checklist that is often the starting point of the marketing process. A marketing plan helps startups identify potential customers, channels, and the ways that the marketing efforts can target them. In fact, the growth of the business is dependent on a solid startup marketing plan and requires timely planning.",
